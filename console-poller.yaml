## Example configuration file


## options: global options that apply to all hosts.
## Any of these can be overidden on per-host level.
options:
  ## poll_interval: interval between running commands on hosts (seconds).
  poll_interval: 180
  ## poll_initial_jitter: randomized delay before first poll for each host (seconds).
  ## This is to avoid resource usage spike on start, when all hosts have to be polled.
  poll_initial_jitter: 180

  ## user/password: authentication credentials for host(s). Empty - auth disabled.
  # user: admin
  # password: admin

  ## telnet: options for establishing telnet connections.
  telnet:
    port: 2233 # XXX
    ## re_*: regexps (python) to match auth and shell prompts.
    re_login: '\bLogin:\s*$'
    re_password: '\bPassword:\s*$'
    re_shell: '#\s*$' # must be matched after auth and before each command

  ## ssh: options for ssh connections via command-line "ssh" binary (openssh).
  ssh:
    ## opts: extra options to pass to binary, either list or a space-separated string.
    ## Note that the binary will read the usual ssh config files as well, things can be specified there.
    ## Default -qT options should probably be always preserved for correct operation.
    ## Example: opts: -qT -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    ## Example: opts: [-qT, -p2222, '-oProxyCommand=ssh -W %h:%p jumphost.example.org']
    opts: -qT
    ## binary: name (will be looked-up in PATH) or full path to openssh "ssh" binary.
    binary: ssh
    ## use_askpass: use ssh_askpass mechanism to authenticate.
    use_askpass: true
    ## re_*: regexps (python) to match auth and shell prompts.
    re_password: '\bpassword:\s*$'
    re_known_hosts: '\bauthenticity of host\b'

  ## cache: various caching options
  cache:
    access_type: true # to avoid trying telnet every time after it's a known-ssh host
    address: true # resolve hostnames for connections only once on start

  ## timeout: how long to wait for each step of the polling process, in seconds.
  timeout:
    connect: 20
    auth: 20
    shell: 10 # for shell prompt to appear before next command
    data: 10 # for first line after each command, if it should be stored in db
    kill: 5 # before sending SIGKILL to unresponsive ssh subprocess


## hosts: names/addresses of hosts to poll and per-host option overrides.
## All options from "options" section apply to each host here, unless overidden.
hosts:
  localhost: # XXX
    user: ssh-test
    password: admin
  # host2:
  #   user: admin
  #   password: admin


## commands: sequence of commands to run (pass on console) for each host.
commands:

  ## command: command line to pass on console.
  ## Note that single or double quotes are also parsed by yaml, so have to be wrapped.
  ## Example: command: 'echo "double quotes get passed to shell here"'
  ## Example: command: "ls -lah 'path with space' \"$PWD\""
  - command: echo val-1 val-2 val-3 444
    ## store_line: if this section is specified for command, first line
    ##  of its output will be stored in the specified database table/columns.
    store_line:
      table: table1 # db table to store output to
      ## columns: sequence of columns for each column of output.
      ## Each sequence item must have a single column name and type as a mapping.
      ## Special auto-filled column types: host (from "hosts" above), time (response timestamp).
      columns:
        - column1: varchar
        - column2: varchar
        - column3: varchar
        - column4: int
        - hostname: host
        - time: time

  # - command: cmd2 -e 'some stuff' -x -- arg1 arg2
  #   store_line:
  #     table: table2
  #     columns:
  #       - column5: varchar
  #       - column6: int
  #       - column7: int
  #       - column8: float
  #       - hostname: host
  #       - time: time

  # ## This command has no "store_line" section, so its output is discarded.
  # - command: shutdown -r


## database: misc SQLite3 database connection options and settings.
database:
  ## path: sqlite db path to use, will be created if missing.
  ## Default is "auto" - to use same path as the config plus .sqlite extension.
  path: auto
  ## commit_delay: seconds to wait before for extra data entries to commit in one batch.
  ## 0 to insert/commit each individual entry immediately.
  commit_delay: 0.5
